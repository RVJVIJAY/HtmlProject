Set to unfold on [Date], this event invites all students to partake in a diverse array of activities, ranging from technical to non-technical competitions.

Each individual is allowed to participate in one event, presenting an opportunity to either showcase your artistic flair or technical expertise.

To ensure everyone's energy levels are sustained throughout the day, we'll be providing snacks and a delicious lunch. However, to cover these expenses, there is a nominal registration fee of Rs. 150 per participant. This fee not only secures your access to the event but also contributes to the overall success of this exciting day.
